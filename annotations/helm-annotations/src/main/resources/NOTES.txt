# Dekorate Autogenerated Notes

To access the Helm annotations or properties you just need to have the following dependency in your
class path:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.dekorate</groupId>
      <artifactId>helm-annotations</artifactId>
      <version>${project.version}</version>
    </dependency>

Compile the project using:

    mvn clean install

You can find the generated Helm artifacts under: `target/classes/META-INF/dekorate/<chart name>/` that should look like:
- Chart.yaml
- values.yaml
- templates/*.yml the generated resources by Dekorate

How can we use it?

First, make sure you have logged into a cluster with Helm enabled (in OpenShift clusters, Helm is enabled by default).

Then, generate the Helm artifacts and push the image into a container registry:

```shell
mvn clean package -Ddekorate.push=true -Ddekorate.docker.registry=<container registry url> -Ddekorate.docker.group=<your group>
```

This command will push the image into the container registry to be available for the cluster when deploying.

Finally, let's use Helm to deploy it into the cluster:

```shell
helm install helm-example ./target/classes/META-INF/dekorate/<chart name>
```

Or upgrade your Helm deployment:

```shell
helm upgrade helm-example ./target/classes/META-INF/dekorate/<chart name>
```
