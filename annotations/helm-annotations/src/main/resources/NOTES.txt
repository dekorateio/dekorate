# Dekorate Autogenerated Notes

To access the Helm annotations or properties you just need to have the following dependency in your
class path:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.dekorate</groupId>
      <artifactId>helm-annotations</artifactId>
      <version>${project.version}</version>
    </dependency>

Build the project using:

    mvn clean install

You can find the generated Helm artifacts under: `target/classes/META-INF/dekorate/helm/<chart name>/` that should look like:
- Chart.yaml
- values.yaml
- templates/*.yml the generated resources by Dekorate

**Note**: The `<chart name>` is set from either the property `dekorate.helm.name` or the `@HelmChart` annotation.

How can it be used?

First, make sure you have installed [the Helm command line](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) and have connected into a cluster.

Then, run the following Maven command in order to generate the Helm artifacts and build/push the image into a container registry:

```shell
mvn clean package -Ddekorate.push=true -Ddekorate.docker.registry=<container registry url> -Ddekorate.docker.group=<your group>
```

This command will push the image to a container registry and will become available when a pod or container is created.

Finally, let's use Helm to deploy it into the cluster:

```shell
helm install helm-example ./target/classes/META-INF/dekorate/helm/<chart name>
```

The above command will deploy a chart using the default values (as defined within the `values.yaml` file). We can override the default values to use your `values.dev.yaml` file by doing:

```shell
helm install helm-example ./target/classes/META-INF/dekorate/helm/<chart name> --values ./target/classes/META-INF/dekorate/helm/<chart name>/values.dev.yaml
```

How can I update my deployment?

- Via the `upgrade` option of Helm command line:

After making changes to your project, you would need to regenerate the resources using Dekorate:

```shell
mvn clean package
```

And then you need to upgrade your deployment:

```shell
helm upgrade helm-example ./target/classes/META-INF/dekorate/helm/<chart name>
```

- Via the `set` option of Helm command line:

```shell
helm upgrade helm-example ./target/classes/META-INF/dekorate/helm/<chart name> --set helmExample.replicas=1
```

How can we delete my deployment?

```shell
helm uninstall helm-example
```
