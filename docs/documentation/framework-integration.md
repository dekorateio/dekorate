###  Framework integration

Framework integration modules are provided that we are able to detect framework annotations and adapt to the framework (e.g. expose ports).

The frameworks supported so far:

- Spring Boot
- Quarkus

Please check the respective guides to know more about how Dekorate works and detects these frameworks.
